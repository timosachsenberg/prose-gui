//! Where the searches are kept (docs/design.md §2): the searches folder of the app's data, `<app data>/searches`,
//! unless the user chose a folder of their own for them (New search and History: "Change…"), e.g. on a drive with room.
//! The choice is kept in `<app data>/searches-folder.json` ([`SETTINGS_FILE`]):
//! `{ "folder": "<path>", "previous": ["<path>", ...] }`.
//!
//! New searches and opened projects go to the current folder. History lists the searches of every folder the app has
//! kept them in ([`Locations::roots`]): the current one, the app's own, and the folders chosen before that still held
//! searches when another was chosen (`previous`); so a search stays in History wherever it is, and is found by its id
//! in these folders, in that order ([`Locations::root_of`]). A search moved by hand (the app closed) from one of
//! them to another is found there.
//!
//! A folder of the user's is taken only when it is empty or holds searches of the app only ([`check_folder`]), and
//! never one inside another searches folder: History lists what is in a searches folder, and offers to delete it. In a
//! folder of the user's, History lists only the folders that are searches ([`crate::history::is_search_folder`]), and the
//! startup sweep removes only partial folders with the app's lock file: nothing else of it is listed, deleted or swept.

// The curation of PSMs: the user marks a PSM as accepted or rejected (the PSM view's buttons, keys A and R), the PSM
// table shows the mark (its Curation column) and filters by it, and the exports write it. The marks are per row of
// `tables.psms` (`ResultModel.curation`, 0 = not curated) and are kept in the search's folder as `curation.json`
// (CURATION_FILE), each PSM by what names it there (file, spectrum, peptide, charge), not by its row: a file that
// another build of the reader would read in another order still finds its PSMs. A project file holds it.
